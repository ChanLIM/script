Cfg2Html (c) by ROSE SWE, Dipl.-Ing. Ralph Roth

This is the "swiss army knife" for the ASE, CE, sysadmin etc.
I wrote it to get the nessary informations to plan an update,
to performe basic trouble shooting or performance analysis.
As a bonus cfg2html creates a nice HTML and plain ASCII
documentation. If you are missing something, let me know it!

S E C U R I T Y
---------------
For security reasons it is better to store the HTML and ASCII files
in a safe place where only root user have access. Then remove the 
files from your file system.

  Usage: cfg2html_linux.sh [OPTION]
  creates HTML and plain ASCII host documentation

  -o            set directory to write or use the environment
                variable OUTDIR="/path/to/dir" (directory must
                exist
  -v            output version information and exit
  -h            display this help and exit

  use the following options to disable collections:

  -s            disable: System
  -c            disable: Cron
  -S            disable: Software
  -f            disable: Filesystem
  -l            disable: LVM
  -k            disable: Kernel
  -e            disable: Enhancements
  -n            disable: Network
  -a            disable: Applications
  -H            disable: Hardware
  -x            don't create background images
